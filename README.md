# angularjs-to-react

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an incremental approach by which a legact AngularJS app can be converted to a React app

The idea is to have tagged commits to show each major step

**Step 1:** Use webpack to bundle/build app

**Step 2:** Add React component to AngularJS app (at a leaf node)

**Step 3:** Add multiple React components to AngularJS app (at various leaf nodes)

**Step 4:** Convert AngularJS app root to a React root so that entire app is built in React!
